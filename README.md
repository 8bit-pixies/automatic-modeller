# Automatic Modeller

A 30 line R script to demonstrate how you can build Automatic models. Inspired by "The Automatic Statistician".

See [RMD/automated-modeller.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/chappers/automatic-modeller/blob/master/RMD/automated-modeller.html) for sample output from this R script.

# To do:

*  Test preprocessing and postprocessing  
*  Customise the document based on the output, rather than having a stock standard template.
